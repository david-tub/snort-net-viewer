# SnortNetViewer
**Interactive network visualization for intrusion detection build on NetworkX, Plotly and Dash**

The framework visualizes Snort alert log files in a node-link/network diagram. It provides several interactive features to explore the information extracted from the log file.

## Corresponding thesis and introduction video
This project is part of the Master Thesis "Interactive Network Visualization for Intrusion Detection" by David Kr√ºger at the DAI Labor at the TU Berlin in winter term 2020/2021.

An introduction video of the visualization framework can be found here:\

## Usage
usage: main.py [-h] [--mode {export-only,export-display,import-display,display-only}] [--file_path FILE_PATH] [--time_ranges TIME_RANGES] [--nodes_file_path NODES_FILE_PATH] [--edges_file_path EDGES_FILE_PATH]


### Modes and example usage
**1. export-only**
- Reads a Snort alert log file and exports the nodes and edges as CSV files (root folder: edges.csv and nodes.csv)
- Example: _main.py --mode export-only --file_path exampleLogs\wannaCry\alert_

**2. display-only**
- Reads a Snort alert log file and visualizes it in the framework web interface
- Example: _main.py --mode display-only --file_path exampleLogs\wannaCry\alert --time_ranges 5_

**3. export-display**
- Reads a Snort alert log file, exports the nodes and edges as CSV files, and visualizes it in the framework web interface
- Example: _main.py --mode export-display --file_path exampleLogs\wannaCry\alert --time_ranges 5_

**4. import-display**
- Reads two CSV files containing the nodes and edges and visualizes them in the framework web interface
- Example: _main.py --mode import-display --nodes_file nodes.csv --edges_file edges.csv_


## Additional Material
The framework was evaluated through a student survey on cybersecurity visualization. The Survey form and the results in the form of a report can be found in the "survey" subfolder.

Example alert log files can be found in the "exampleLogs" subfolder.
